# Mellon Collie Deluxe Edition Info App

Created for the Musical Structure App project as part of the Andoid Basics Nanodegree at Udacity.

It's an information app about the deluxe vinyl re-issue of one the best albums ever recorded, Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness by Smashing Pumpkins.

The main aim of the project were to create custom objects and have an adapter feed them into a custom list array (in this case, the track list). There's no audio functionality as it's not a requirement here but I might add that later. There's also a page for some brief info about the box set and small bios about the members of the band at that legendary moment in time and a BUY button which launches a google shopping page in your browser.
